# Read Journey

Hello, my name's Eva Mykhno. I'm a frontend developer, and I'm excited to introduce my project!

## Project layout

To create the Read Journey project, I used [this layout](https://www.figma.com/file/z3m0rdBcEfLTJUBDkAKhWQ/BOOKS-READING?type=design&node-id=18743%3A4973&mode=design&t=Hi1KTaUJMogWXZzz-1) from Figma.

## Project Description

This web application with adaptive layout improves the user's reading experience. A registered user can start reading one of the recommended books by adding it to their personal library. They can filter books by author or title to find something interesting. In addition, users can add their own books to the library by specifying the author, title, and number of pages. After selecting a book, the application will help track individual reading sessions and calculate the user's reading speed.

### Website [Read Journey](https://read-journey-one.vercel.app/)

## Application pages:

### Register Page:

On the registration page, the user must enter his name, email and password. If the user has an account, he can go to the login page.

### Recommended Page

![Screenshot of my projects' register page](/public/register.jpg)
On the recommended page, the user sees a list of books available for reading. Their number is displayed depending on the user's screen. The user can see the next/previous page of recommended books using the pagination arrows. Also on this page, the user can find a book by title or author. Clicking on the cover will open a modal window with detailed information about the book. There is also a button here that, when clicked, will add the book to the user's library.

### My Library Page

![Screenshot of my projects' library page](/public/library.jpg)
The library page displays a list of all the books the user wants to read. It is also possible to add the user's own book. In addition, on this page the user can filter books by reading progress. After clicking on the book cover, a modal window opens with the ability to go to the reading page.

### Reading Page

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="/public/statistics.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my project's statistics on the reading page" width="49%">
  <img src="/public/diary.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my project's diary on the reading page" width="49%">
</div>

On the book reading page, the user sees a form where he needs to enter the page number of the start/stop reading. Also on this page, statistics (progress bar) or a diary containing information about all reading sessions are displayed.
